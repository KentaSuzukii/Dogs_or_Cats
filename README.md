# Dogs vs. Cats Image Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements a binary image classification model to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. It uses a dataset of labeled images and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve accurate classification.

## Dataset
The dataset contains images categorized into two classes:  
- Dogs  
- Cats  

- Images in the `train/` folder are used for training the model.
- Images in the `test/` folder are used for evaluating the model.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed. Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
